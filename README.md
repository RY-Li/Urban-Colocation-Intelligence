Topic: Urban Colocation Intelligence: Mapping Amenity Clusters and Dependency Networks Using Open-Source POI Data


This project aims to develop a scalable, open-source toolkit for identifying and analyzing clusters of urban amenities and their underlying colocation networks. By leveraging geospatial datasets such as OpenStreetMap, Ordnance Survey, Overture Maps, and potentially user mobility data, the project will map how different types of amenities co-locate across different cities and benchmark these patterns across different urban geographies. A core feature of the toolkit is the reconstruction of amenity dependency networks, which model how the presence of one type of place (e.g., schools, caf√©s) conditions the likelihood of others (e.g., parks, gyms) being nearby as well as their dependency networks based on mobility patterns. The tool will enable insights into how amenity configurations align with local demographic profiles, behavioral typologies, and planning priorities.
